My Data Science Portfolio

# Project 1
# [Emotion AI](https://github.com/Kasha-13/Emotion_AI)                                                                             
Image Visualization 
• Built key facial point detection model.
• Performed Image augmentation and data normalization
• Built Deep Residual Neural Network key facial expression detection model.
• Combined both expression and key points detection models to predict the facial expressions.

# Project 2
## Tumor detection
AI in Healthcare                                                                               
• Detection and localizing brain tumors based on MRI scans were performed
• From the input images, image segmentation was performed to understand and extract the information from images at 
  the pixel level and to train a neural network to produce a pixel-wise mask of the image.
• Diseases diagnosis with medical imaging with improved speed and better accuracy

# Project 3
# [MNIST Classifier](https://github.com/Kasha-13/MNIST)
I was able to create SVM classifier with the accuracy of 98%.
Did Error Analysis for the improvement of the model.

# project 4
# [Data Visualization using Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/akash4773#!/vizhome/ProfitorLoss_16155416805000/Story1?publish=yes)
Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the Superstore dataset
