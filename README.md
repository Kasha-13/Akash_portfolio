## Project 1: [Multimodal vs. Vision-Based Cancer Detection (ISIC 2024 – Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akashkanojiya/cancer-prediction-isic-2024)

- Developed cancer detection models using deep learning (ResNet, transfer learning) and tree-based models to classify malignant vs. benign skin lesions.
- Built a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Azure OpenAI Studio, integrating OpenAI Embeddings, structured patient data, and lesion images to explore hybrid approaches in medical diagnostics. [Notebook Link](https://github.com/Kasha-13/multimodal_rag_cancer_detection_01)
- Conducted a comparative evaluation between the multimodal RAG system and a traditional tree-based classifier using ResNet-extracted features. Published findings in a public Kaggle notebook, concluding that while both models were competitive, the computer vision-based approach outperformed in this specific diagnostic task.



## Project 2: [Team Ranking](https://github.com/Kasha-13/Team_Ranking.git)

- Researched flaws in existing team ranking systems and analyzed alternative approaches.
- Applied a Bivariate Poisson model with an interaction parameter in R to predict Germany’s football team rankings using FIFA data.
- Evaluated model accuracy using win-draw-loss error rates, re-ranked teams accordingly, and compared results with existing ranking systems to highlight key discrepancies.
- Presented findings in a detailed report and seminar, demonstrating data-driven insights.


## Project 3: [Emotion AI](https://github.com/Kasha-13/AI-Emotion)                                                                             
Image Visualization 
- Built key facial point detection model.
- Performed Image augmentation and data normalization
- Built Deep Residual Neural Network key facial expression detection model.
- Combined both expression and key points detection models to predict the facial expressions.

## Project 4: [Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Kasha-13/Marketing-AI)
-	The goal was to know the customers and indentify  their needs, which helps the marketer to launch a targeted Marketing
-	Performed PCA for dimension reduction
-	Used  elbow method to determine the optimal number of distinct clusters and clustered the observations using K means Aklgorithm.


## Project 5: [Tumor Detection](https://github.com/Kasha-13/Tumor_detection)
- Developed a classifier model using ResNet(Transfer learning), which predicts a person having tumor or not using brain MRI images.
- Built a model to localize the tumor when the classifier model predicts positive using RESUNET.

## Project 6: [MNIST Classifier](https://github.com/Kasha-13/MNIST)
- Built SVM classifier with the accuracy of 98%.
- Implemented Error Analysis for the improvement of the model.
