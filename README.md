# Project 1
# [Emotion AI](https://github.com/Kasha-13/Emotion_AI)                                                                             
Image Visualization 
• Built key facial point detection model.
• Performed Image augmentation and data normalization
• Built Deep Residual Neural Network key facial expression detection model.
• Combined both expression and key points detection models to predict the facial expressions.
