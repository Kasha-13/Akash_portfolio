My Data Science Portfolio

# Project 1
# [Multimodal vs. Vision-Based Cancer Detection (ISIC 2024 – Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akashkanojiya/cancer-prediction-isic-2024)
• Developed cancer detection models using deep learning (ResNet, transfer learning) and tree-based models to classify malignant vs. benign skin lesions.
• Built a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Azure OpenAI Studio, integrating OpenAI Embeddings structured patient data, and lesion images to 
  explore hybrid approaches in medical diagnostics. Notebook Link (https://github.com/Kasha-13/multimodal_rag_cancer_detection_01)
• Conducted a comparative evaluation between the multimodal RAG system and a traditional tree-based classifier using ResNet-extracted features. Published findings in a 
  public Kaggle notebook, concluding that while both models were competitive, the computer vision-based approach outperformed in this specific diagnostic task.
  
# Project 2
# [Emotion AI](https://github.com/Kasha-13/AI-Emotion)                                                                             
Image Visualization 
• Built key facial point detection model.
• Performed Image augmentation and data normalization
• Built Deep Residual Neural Network key facial expression detection model.
• Combined both expression and key points detection models to predict the facial expressions.

# Project 3
# [Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Kasha-13/Marketing-AI)
•	The goal was to know the customers and indentify  their needs, which helps the marketer to launch a targeted
Marketing
•	Performed PCA for dimension reduction
•	Used  elbow method to determine the optimal number of distinct clusters and clustered the observations 
using K means Aklgorithm.

# Project 4
# [Tumor Detection](https://github.com/Kasha-13/Tumor_detection)
Developed a classifier model using ResNet(Transfer learning), which predicts a person having tumor or not using brain MRI images.
Built a model to localize the tumor when the classifier model predicts positive using RESUNET.

# Project 5
# [MNIST Classifier](https://github.com/Kasha-13/MNIST)
I was able to create SVM classifier with the accuracy of 98%.
Did Error Analysis for the improvement of the model.
